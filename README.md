# Next Auth
This is a really simple (and very technical) application to practice authentication and authorization in the frontend.

In this project, I've applied some concepts like JWT, refresh token, user permissions, communication between browser tabs/windows using the Broadcast Channel API, server-side processing and more...

# Tech Stack
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Nookies](https://nextjs.org/)

Important: it depends of [this API](https://github.com/rocketseat-education/ignite-reactjs-auth-backend) to work properly.
